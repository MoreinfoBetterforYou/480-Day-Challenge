/*  Practice exercise 1.4
        Adding comments:
            1. Add a new statement to your JavaScript code by setting a variable value.
            Since we will cover this in the next chapter, you can use the following line:
            let a = 10;
            2. Add a comment at the end of the statement indicating that you set a value of
            10.
            3. Print the value using console.log(). Add a comment explaining what this
            will do.
            4. At the end of your JavaScript code, use a multiple-line comment. In a real
            production script, you might use this space to add a brief outline of the
            purpose of the file.

let a = 10; // The value of a is set to 10.
console.log(a); // console.log() will be used to log the value of the variable a in the console.

/* The main purpose of this file is to declare a variable "a" using the let keyword and then assiging it the value of 10. Then using console.log() to log the value of the variable 'a' in the console. */
